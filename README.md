# google-api-objectivec-client
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/google-api-objectivec-client

This framework is needed for using Google Services API v3.
It is huge, it is not recomended to use it full in the app. 

It is better to add only required subspecs via Cocoapods:

``` ruby
  pod 'Google-API-ObjectiveC-Client/YouTube', '3.0.1' 
```
